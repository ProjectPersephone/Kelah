This repo contains software required for design and evaluation of a tapered, rotating sling on the Moon, to be made of basalt. The basic idea was presented at ASTRO 2018 in Quebec city on the ISRU track. [ Here is the slide deck.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y1jP8hRLgbWr4L6fo6iZS44rJHLD3KsNfQzVE6vxcoY/edit#slide=id.p) The submitted paper (draft) was ["A rotating, tapered, balanced sling launcher on the Moon made of lunar regolith basalt fiber"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16fFAHxTOhwzMlulDfoD0ossUIoAz0a9C6NrqbgVG_jE/edit). There is also [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uNU0QBKSqW0r44z_62FYlct5pNCvpTBvi3c9_GTwkyA/edit#gid=1985164543) for computing sling mass given sling arm tether material and payload mass.

Included are some POVray sources for generating animations of the sling in operation.
